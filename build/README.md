# Build directory
This directory is where the output files of the data collation process will go.
Those will be available as generic data, but will also be subsequently used in the Anki-deck creation pass.
These files are generated by `kanken_processor.py`, but they will be available in the Releases section.
This document exists merely to explain the structure of each.

## Output files
- `verbs.tsv`: document containing only verbs
- `adjectives.tsv`: document containing adjectives, such as 形容詞 and 形容動詞
- `indeclinable.tsv`: document containing any other part of speech, like nouns and adverbs, which have the same overall appearance
- `kanji.tsv`: document containing kanji
